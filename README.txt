A fully functioning ver simple and usefull CRM app build with Django.

Compare to my other Django projects solely focused on building views with functions rather that classes.

It was a semi-guided but mostly had to check the code to understand the logic where i couldn't make sense.

To have it just clone and if anybody has a good change let me hook!
